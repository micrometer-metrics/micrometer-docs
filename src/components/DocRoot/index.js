      <p>
        Micrometer provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular observability systems,
        allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. Think SLF4J, but for
        application observability! Data recorded by Micrometer are intended to be used to observe, alert, and
        react to the current/recent operational state of your environment.
