Auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of all available `Cache` instances on startup,
with metrics prefixed by `cache`. Cache instrumentation is standardized for a basic set
of metrics. Additional, cache-specific metrics are also available.

The following cache libraries are supported:

* Caffeine
* EhCache 2
* Hazelcast
* Any compliant JCache (JSR-107) implementation

Metrics are tagged by the name of the cache and by the name of the `CacheManager`, which is
derived from the bean name.
