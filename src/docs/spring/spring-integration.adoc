If Spring Integration is on the classpath, metrics for Spring integration are collected automatically.

Three gauges are monitored:

* `spring.integration.channelNames`: Number of channel names
* `spring.integration.handlerNames`: Number of handler names
* `spring.integration.sourceNames`: Number of source names

For each source, a counter (`spring.integration.source.messages`) is registered.
