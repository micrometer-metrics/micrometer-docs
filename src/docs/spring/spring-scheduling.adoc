Enabling metrics in your Spring Boot application plus enabling AOP configures AOP advice that times `@Scheduled` methods. For a method to be timed, it must be marked as `@Timed` with a name -- for example: `Timed("my.metric.name")`.

Depending on the duration of the scheduled task, you may want to choose to time the method with a `LongTaskTimer`, a `Timer`, or both (generally it is not both). The following code snippet shows an example of measuring a scheduled task with both long task and regular timings:

[source,java]
----
@Timed("beep")
@Timed(value = "long.beep", longTask = true)
@Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000)
void longBeep() {
    // calculate the meaning of life, then beep...
    System.out.println("beep");
}
