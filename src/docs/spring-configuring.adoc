Spring Boot autoconfigures a composite meter registry and adds a registry to the composite for each of the supported implementations that it finds on the classpath. Having a dependency on `micrometer-registry-{system}` in your runtime classpath is enough for Spring Boot to configure the registry. Spring Boot will also add any autoconfigured registries to the global static composite registry on the `Metrics` class unless you explicitly tell it not to by setting:

[source,yml]
----
# true by default
spring.metrics.useGlobalRegistry: false
----

Leaving configuration of the global registry on enables you to collect metrics from libraries that use the static global registry to wire their metrics without doing anything further.

You can control whether a registry implementation is autoconfigured via a property, even if it is otherwise present on the classpath:

[source,yml,subs=+attributes]
----
# true by default
spring.metrics.{system}.enabled: false
----

The location of the endpoint in Spring Boot 2.0 is `/application/prometheus`. By default it is disabled, but can be enabled with `endpoints.default.web.enabled=true` in application.properties.

*Optionally* register any number of `MeterRegistryConfigurer`s to further configure the registry (such as applying common tags) before any meters are registered with the registry.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    @Bean
    MeterRegistryConfigurer configurer() {
      return registry -> registry.config().commonTags("region", "us-east-1");
    }
}

ifeval::["{system}" == "atlas"]
Below is a list of the most common configuration properties you will want to change and their default values
(from any property source, e.g. application.yml):

```yml
# The location of your Atlas server
spring.metrics.atlas.uri: http://localhost:7101/api/v1/publish

# You will probably want disable Atlas publishing in a local development profile.
spring.metrics.atlas.enabled: true

# The interval at which metrics are sent to Atlas. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
# The default is 1 minute.
spring.metrics.atlas.step: PT1M
```

For a full list of configuration properties that can influence Atlas publishing, see
`com.netflix.spectator.atlas.AtlasConfig`.

ifeval::["{system}" == "prometheus"]
If Spring Boot Actuator is on the classpath, an actuator endpoint will be wired to `/prometheus` by default that presents a Prometheus scrape with the appropriate format.

To add actuator if it isn't already present on your classpath in Gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator'
----

Or in Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

If you'd like the endpoint to be wired to a different endpoint, add a property:

```yml
endpoints.prometheus.id: micrometheus
```

Here is an example `scrape_config` to add to prometheus.yml:

```yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring'
    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HOST:PORT']
```
endif::[]

ifeval::["{system}" == "datadog"]
The Datadog registry pushes metrics to datadoghq periodically. Below is a list of
the most common configuration properties you will want to change and their default values
(from any property source, e.g. application.yml):

```yml
spring.metrics.datadog.apiKey: YOURKEY

# You will probably want disable Atlas publishing in a local development profile.
spring.metrics.datadog.enabled: true

# The interval at which metrics are sent to Datadog. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
# The default is 10 seconds, which matches the Datadog Agent publishes at.
spring.metrics.datadog.step: PT10S
```

For a full list of configuration properties that can influence Datadog publishing, see
`io.micrometer.core.instrument.datadog.DatadogConfig`.

== Meter Binders

The `JvmMemoryMetrics` binder will be automatically configured to record memory and buffer pool utilization. In the presence of Logback, the `LogbackMetrics` binder will also be configured to record the number of events logged to Logback at each level.

To register other binders with the registry, add them as `@Bean`s to your application context:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
ThreadMetrics threadMetrics() {
    return new ThreadMetrics();
}
----
