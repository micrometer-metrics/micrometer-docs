== Handler Configuration

For Micrometer Tracing to work with Micrometer, you need to add a tracing related `TimerRecordingHandler`.
Check the example below for an example of adding and using a single, `DefaultTracingRecordingHandler`.

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----

    // `tracer` is a Micrometer Tracing compliant Tracer. Micrometer Tracing supports
    // Brave and OpenTelemetry Tracers out of the box. You would need to set it up manually
    // or have it injected by a DI framework.
    MeterRegistry meterRegistry = new SimpleMeterRegistry();
    // We set up a single `TimerRecordingHandler` in the `MeterRegistry` configuration
    meterRegistry.config().timerRecordingHandler(new DefaultTracingRecordingHandler(tracer));

    // Creating a new Sample
    // Via the `DefaultTracingRecordingHandler` that will create a new Span and start it
    Timer.Sample sample = Timer.start(meterRegistry, new Timer.HandlerContext() {

		// This tags will be added to metrics and spans
		@Override
        public Tags getLowCardinalityTags() {
            return Tags.of(Tag.of("this.tag", "will end up as a meter tag and a span tag"));
        }

		// This tags will be added only to spans
        @Override
        public Tags getHighCardinalityTags() {
            return Tags.of(Tag.of("but.this.tag", "will end up as a span tag only"));
        }
    });

	// Make the Sample current
    // This will result in making the previously created Span, the current Span - it's in ThreadLocal
    try (Timer.Scope scope = sample.makeCurrent()) {
		// Run your code that you want to measure - still the attached Span is the current one
        // This means that e.g. logging frameworks could inject to e.g. MDC tracing information
        yourCodeToMeasure();
    }
    finally {
        // The corresponding Span will no longer be in ThreadLocal due to try-with-resources block (Timer.Scope is an AutoCloseable)
		// Stop the Sample
        // The corresponding Span will be stopped and reported to an external system
        sample.stop(Timer.builder("my.operation"));
    }
-----

This will result in the following Micrometer Metrics:

```
Gathered the following metrics
	Meter with name <my.operation> and type <TIMER> has the following measurements
		<[
            Measurement{statistic='COUNT', value=1.0},
            Measurement{statistic='TOTAL_TIME', value=1.011949454},
            Measurement{statistic='MAX', value=1.011949454}
        ]>
		and has the following tags <[tag(this.tag=will end up as a meter tag and a span tag)]>
```

And the following trace view in e.g. Zipkin

=== Ordered Handler Configuration

Micrometer Tracing comes with multiple `TimerRecordingHandler` implementations.
To introduce ordering, you can use the `TimerRecordingHandler.AllMatchingCompositeTimerRecordingHandler` to run logic for all `RecordingHandler` that are matching the given predicate and `TimerRecordingHandler.FirstMatchingCompositeTimerRecordingHandler` to run logic only for the first `TimerRecordingHandler` that matches the predicate.
The former can group or handlers and the latter can be chosen to e.g. run only one matching `TracingRecordingHandler`.
