In this section, we describe how to use the Micrometer Tracing API to directly create and report spans.

== Micrometer Tracing Examples

The following example shows the basic operations on a span. Read the comments in the snippet for details:

The following example shows how to continue a span that was started in another thread in a new thread:

The following example shows how to create a child span when explicitly knowing who the parent span is:

== Micrometer Tracing Brave Setup

In this subsection, we set up Micrometer Tracing with Brave.

The following example shows how to create a Micrometer Tracing `Tracer` by using Brave components that would send completed spans to Zipkin:

== Micrometer Tracing OpenTelemetry Setup

In this subsection, we set up Micrometer Tracing with OpenTelemetry (OTel).

The following example shows how to create a Micrometer Tracing `Tracer` by using OTel components that would send completed spans to Zipkin:

== Micrometer Tracing Baggage API

Traces connect from service to service by using header propagation. Besides trace identifiers, other properties (called `Baggage`) can also be passed along with the request.

The following example shows how to use the Tracer API (version `1.0.x`) to create and extract baggage:

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//                         Example for Tracing 1.0.x
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::../../../samples/src/test/java/io/micrometer/docs/tracing/TracingApiTests.java[tags=baggage_api,indent=0]
-----

The following example shows how to use the Tracer API (version `1.1.x`) to create and extract baggage:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//                         Example for Tracing 1.1.x
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

include::../../../samples/src/test/java/io/micrometer/docs/tracing/TracingApiTests.java[tags=baggage_api_1_11_0,indent=0]

IMPORTANT: For Brave, remember to set up the `PropagationFactory` so that it contains the baggage fields that you will be using in your code. Check the following example for details:

== Aspect Oriented Programming (starting from Micrometer Tracing 1.1.0)

IMPORTANT: This section is applicable from Micrometer Tracing 1.1.0.

Micrometer Tracing contains `@NewSpan`, `@ContinueSpan`, and `@SpanTag` annotations that frameworks can use to create or customize spans for either specific types of methods such as those serving web request endpoints or, more generally, to all methods.

WARNING: Micrometer's Spring Boot configuration does _not_ recognize these aspects on arbitrary methods.

An AspectJ aspect is included. You can use it in your application, either through compile/load time AspectJ weaving or through framework facilities that interpret AspectJ aspects and proxy targeted methods in some other way, such as Spring AOP. Here is a sample Spring AOP configuration:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::../../../samples/src/test/java/io/micrometer/docs/tracing/TracingSpanAspectTests.java[tags=spring_config,indent=0]
-----

Applying `SpanAspect` makes `@NewSpan` and `@ContinueSpan` usable on any arbitrary method in an AspectJ proxied instance, as the following example shows:
