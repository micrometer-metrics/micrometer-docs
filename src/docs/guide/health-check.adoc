= Spring Boot health as a metric
Jon Schneider <jschneider@pivotal.io>

Spring Boot contains an health abstraction whose status contains four states: up, down, out of service, and unknown. It is possible to convert these states to some set of numbers so you can monitor or alert on levels of health for a particular app.

Below is one such mapping before Spring Boot 2.2:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
class HealthMetricsConfiguration {
    // This should be a field so it doesn't get garbage collected
    private CompositeHealthIndicator healthIndicator;

    public HealthMetricsConfiguration(HealthAggregator healthAggregator,
                                      List<HealthIndicator> healthIndicators,
                                      MeterRegistry registry) {

        healthIndicator = new CompositeHealthIndicator(healthAggregator);

        for (Integer i = 0; i < healthIndicators.size(); i++) {
            healthIndicator.addHealthIndicator(i.toString(), healthIndicators.get(i));
        }

        // presumes there is a common tag applied elsewhere that adds tags for app, etc.
        registry.gauge("health", emptyList(), healthIndicator, health -> {
            Status status = health.health().getStatus();
            switch (status.getCode()) {
                case "UP":
                    return 3;
                case "OUT_OF_SERVICE":
                    return 2;
                case "DOWN":
                    return 1;
                case "UNKNOWN":
                default:
                    return 0;
            }
        });
    }
}

Below is one such mapping since Spring Boot 2.2:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class HealthMetricsConfig {

	public HealthMetricsConfig(
			StatusAggregator statusAggregator, HealthContributorRegistry healthContributorRegistry,
			MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
		HealthMetricsProvider healthMetricsProvider = new HealthMetricsProvider(
				healthContributorRegistry, statusAggregator);
		Gauge.builder("health", healthMetricsProvider, HealthMetricsProvider::getValue)
				.strongReference(true)
				.register(meterRegistry);
	}

	private static class HealthMetricsProvider {

		private final HealthContributorRegistry healthContributorRegistry;
		private final StatusAggregator statusAggregator;

		HealthMetricsProvider(HealthContributorRegistry healthContributorRegistry, StatusAggregator statusAggregator) {
			this.healthContributorRegistry = healthContributorRegistry;
			this.statusAggregator = statusAggregator;
		}

		private double getValue() {
			Set<Status> statuses = this.healthContributorRegistry.stream()
					.map(NamedContributor::getContributor)
					.filter(HealthIndicator.class::isInstance)
					.map(HealthIndicator.class::cast)
					.map((healthIndicator) -> healthIndicator.getHealth(false).getStatus())
					.collect(Collectors.toSet());
			Status aggregatedStatus = this.statusAggregator.getAggregateStatus(statuses);
			switch (aggregatedStatus.getCode()) {
				case "UP":
					return 3;
				case "OUT_OF_SERVICE":
					return 2;
				case "DOWN":
					return 1;
				case "UNKNOWN":
				default:
					return 0;
			}
		}

	}

}

The range of numbers you map the statuses to are of course arbitrary, as are the ordering of the statuses to some extent. For example, in this case you could set an alert on "health < 2" to capture unknown and down states. Whether unknown is consider "better" or "worse" than down is a matter of preference.

NOTE: Custom states can also be created and used throughout the Spring Boot Health subsystem.

A totally different model would be to map statuses to tags, report 1 when the app matches a status and 0 otherwise:

[source,java]
----
registry.gauge("health", Tags.of("status", "up"), healthIndicator,
        h -> "UP".equals(h.health().getStatus().getCode()) ? 1 : 0);

registry.gauge("health", Tags.of("status", "down"), healthIndicator,
        h -> "DOWN".equals(h.health().getStatus().getCode()) ? 1 : 0);
