SignalFx is a dimensional monitoring system SaaS with a full UI operating on a push model. It has a rich set of alert "detectors".

== Configuring

[source,java]
----
SignalFxConfig signalfxConfig = new SignalFxConfig() {
    @Override
    public String accessToken() {
        return "MYTOKEN";
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};

MeterRegistry registry = new SignalFxMeterRegistry(signalfxConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

There are two distinct sources of API keys in SignalFx.

`SignalFxConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you  instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.signalfx` directly to the `SignalFxConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.signalfx:
    access-token: MYTOKEN

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Ganglia. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
    # The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in SignalFx for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/charts/index.html[SignalFx docs] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in SignalFx.

=== Timers

At each publishing interval, the SignalFx `Timer` produces several time series in SignalFx:

1. `${name}.avg` - A mean latency for the publishing interval.
2. `${name}.count` - Throughput per second over the publishing interval.
3. `${name}.totalTime` - Total time per second over the publishing interval (used with `count`) to create aggregable means.
4. `${name}.percentiles` - Micrometer calculated percentiles for the publishing interval. One time series is produced for each percentile, with a tag of `phi` in the range [0,1].
5. `${name}.histogram` - One event is produced for each SLA boundary with a tag of 'le', indicating that it represents a cumulative count of events less than or equal to SLA boundaries over the publishing interval.

To generate an aggregable view of latency in SignalFx, divide `totalTime` by `count`:

This is accomplished by adding signals for `${name}.totalTime` and `${name}.count`, adding a formula that divides them, and hiding the inputs to the formula.

To generate a throughput chart, use the `${name}.count` signal:

.Timer throughput.

To generate a plot of client-side percentiles, use the `${name}.percentiles` signal:

.Timer Percentiles.

Note how these percentiles are _not aggregable_. The more dimensions you add to a timer, the less useful these values become.

Lastly, if you define SLA boundaries with the fluent builder for `Timer`, you can view throughput below certain SLA boundaries using the `${name}.histogram` signal. In this example, we set SLA boundaries at 275 (green), 300 (blue), and 500 (purple) milliseconds for a simulated `Timer` that is recording samples normally distributed around 250 ms. These counts represent the rate/second of samples less than or equal to each SLA boundary.

Where the lines converge at various points it is evident that no sample exceeded the 275 ms SLA boundary.
