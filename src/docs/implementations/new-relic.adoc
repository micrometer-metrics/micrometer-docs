New Relic offers a dimensional monitoring system product called Insights with a full UI and a query language called NRQL. New Relic Insights operates on a push model. Some features of NRQL assume that Insights receives a distinct event payload for every timing, count, etc. Micrometer instead ships aggregates at a prescribed interval, allowing your app's throughput to scale without concern for event propagation to Insights becoming a bottleneck.

== Configuring

[source,java]
----
NewRelicConfig newRelicConfig = new NewRelicConfig() {
    @Override
    public String accountId() {
        return "MYACCOUNT";
    }

    @Override
    public String apiKey() {
        return "MY_INSIGHTS_API_KEY";
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};

MeterRegistry registry = new NewRelicMeterRegistry(newRelicConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

There are two distinct sources of API keys in New Relic.

`NewRelicConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you  instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.newrelic` directly to the `NewRelicConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.newrelic:
    account-id: MYACCOUNT
    api-key: MY_INSIGHTS_API_KEY

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Ganglia. See Duration.parse for the expected format.
    # The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in New Relic for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql[New Relic NRQL docs] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in New Relic.

=== Timers

At each publishing interval, the New Relic `Timer` produces a single event with the timer's name and several attributes:

1. `avg` - A mean latency for the publishing interval.
2. `count` - Throughput per second over the publishing interval.
3. `totalTime` - Total time per second over the publishing interval (used with `count`) to create aggregable means.

Additionally, if any percentiles or SLA buckets are defined on the timer, additional events are produced:

4. `${name}.percentiles` - Micrometer calculated percentiles for the publishing interval. One event is produced for each percentile, with a tag of `phi` in the range [0,1].
5. `${name}.histogram` - One event is produced for each SLA boundary with a tag of 'le', indicating that it represents a cumulative count of events less than or equal to SLA boundaries over the publishing interval.

To generate an aggregable view of latency in New Relic, divide `totalTime` by `count`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sum(totalTime)/sum(count) as 'Average Latency', max(max) as 'Max' FROM timer since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

To generate a throughput chart:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT average(count) as 'Average Throughput' FROM timer since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer throughput.
image::img/new-relic-timer-throughput.png[New Relic-rendered timer throughput]

To generate a plot of client-side percentiles:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT latest(value) from timerPercentile FACET phi since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer Percentiles.
image::img/new-relic-timer-percentiles.png[New Relic-rendered percentiles]

Note how these percentiles are _not aggregable_. We've selected the `latest(value)` function to display this chart (i.e. it isn't correct to `average(value)` on a percentile value). The more dimensions you add to a timer, the less useful these values become.

Lastly, if you define SLA boundaries with the fluent builder for `Timer`, you can view throughput below certain SLA boundaries. In this example, we set SLA boundaries at 275 (yellow), 300 (red), and 500 (blue) milliseconds for a simulated `Timer` that is recording samples normally distributed around 250 ms. These counts represent the rate/second of samples less than or equal to each SLA boundary.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sum(value) from timerHistogram FACET le since 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES auto
----

.Timer SLA boundaries.
image::img/new-relic-timer-sla.png[New Relic-rendered SLA boundaries]

Where the lines converge at various points it is evident that no sample exceeded the 275 ms SLA boundary.
