Graphite is one of the most popular current hierarchical metrics systems backed by a fixed-size database, similar in design and purpose to RRDtool. It originated at Orbitz in 2006 and was open sourced in 2008.

== Configuring

[source,java]
----
GraphiteConfig graphiteConfig = new GraphiteConfig() {
    @Override
    public String host() {
        return "mygraphitehost";
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};

MeterRegistry registry = new GraphiteMeterRegistry(graphiteConfig, Clock.SYSTEM, HierarchicalNameMapper.DEFAULT);
----

Micrometer uses Dropwizard Metrics as the underlying instrumentation library when recording metrics destined for Graphite. `GraphiteConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you  instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.graphite` directly to the `GraphiteConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.graphite:
    # The location of your Graphite server
    host: mygraphitehost

    # You will probably want to conditionally disable Graphite publishing in local development.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Graphite. The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m

== Graphite Tag Support

As of Micrometer version 1.4.0, Micrometer supports exporting Graphite metrics using tags instead of the traditional hierarchical format.  Metrics are exported using the tag format by default unless any `tagsAsPrefix` values are configured.
https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tags.html[Tag support] was added to Graphite in the 1.1.0 Graphite release.
If you wish to revert to the traditional hierarchical format, ensure that the `graphiteTagsEnabled` config value is set to `false`.
The following documentation sections on hierarchical name mapping and metrics prefixing are only applicable if tag support is disabled.

include::hierarchical-name-mapping.adoc[]

== Prefixing your metrics

To add a prefix to all metrics going to graphite, use the `GraphiteConfig#tagsAsPrefix` configuration option. This option applies the tag value of a set of common tags as a prefix. For example, if `tagsAsPrefix` contains "application", and a meter named "myTimer" is created with a tag "application=APPNAME", it will appear in Graphite as "APPNAME.myTimer".

Generally, when using `tagsAsPrefix`, add common tags to the registry so that the tags are present on all meters belonging to that registry:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MeterRegistryCustomizer<MeterRegistry> commonTags() {
   return r -> r.config().commonTags("application", "APPNAME");
}
----

The reason we do it this way is because generally a tag prefix in Graphite is correlated to a common tag elsewhere. Prefixes tend to be something like app name or host. By applying those values as common tags, you make your metrics more portable (i.e. if you ever switched to a dimensional monitoring system, you're set!).


You can use this when the order of the prefix matters. Micrometer always sorts tags but the order of tag keys in `tagsAsPrefix` is preserved, so adding `host`, `application` to `tagsAsPrefix` results in a prefixed metric like `HOST.APP.myCounter`.

To meet your specific naming needs, you can also provide a custom hierarchical name mapper when creating `GraphiteMeterRegistry` as follows:

[source,java]
----
GraphiteMeterRegistry r = new GraphiteMeterRegistry(
            GraphiteConfig.DEFAULT,
            Clock.SYSTEM,
            (id, convention) -> "prefix." + HierarchicalNameMapper.DEFAULT.toHierarchicalName(id, convention));
----

NOTE: If you use a custom `HierarchicalNameMapper`, `tagsAsPrefix` will be ignored.

== Further customizing the `GraphiteReporter`

We give you the option to configure `GraphiteReporter` yourself if you need further customization. Just use this constructor and provide your own `GraphiteReporter`:

[source,java]
----
GraphiteMeterRegistry(GraphiteConfig config, Clock clock, HierarchicalNameMapper nameMapper,
                      MetricRegistry metricRegistry, GraphiteReporter reporter)
----

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in Graphite for metrics originating in Micrometer.

=== Counters

Graphite counters measure mean throughput and one-, five-, and fifteen-minute exponentially-weighted moving average throughputs.
