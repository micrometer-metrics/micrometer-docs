Prometheus is an in-memory dimensional time series database with a simple built-in UI, a custom query language, and math operations. Prometheus is designed to operate on a pull model, scraping metrics from application instances periodically based on service discovery.

== Configuring

Prometheus expects to scrape or poll individual app instances for metrics. In addition to creating a Prometheus registry, you also need to expose an HTTP endpoint to Prometheus' scraper. In a Spring environment, a Prometheus actuator endpoint is autoconfigured in the presence of Spring Boot Actuator. Otherwise, you can use any JVM-based HTTP server implementation to expose scrape data to Prometheus.

The example below uses the JDK's `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` to expose a scrape endpoint:

[source,java]
----
PrometheusMeterRegistry prometheusRegistry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);

try {
    HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8080), 0);
    server.createContext("/prometheus", httpExchange -> {
        String response = prometheusRegistry.scrape(); <1>
        httpExchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.getBytes().length);
        try (OutputStream os = httpExchange.getResponseBody()) {
            os.write(response.getBytes());
        }
    });

    new Thread(server::start).start();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
----
<1> The `PrometheusMeterRegistry` contains a `scrape()` function that knows how to supply the String data necessary for the scrape. All you have to do is wire it to an endpoint.

=== The Prometheus rename filter

In some cases, Micrometer provides out-of-the-box instrumentation that overlaps with commonly used Prometheus simpleclient modules, but has chosen a different naming scheme for consistency/portability. If you wish to use the Prometheus "standard" names, add the filter:

[source,java]
----
prometheusRegistry.config().meterFilter(new PrometheusRenameFilter());

== Graphing

This section serves as a quickstart to rendering useful representations in Prometheus for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/basics[Prometheus docs] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in Prometheus.

=== Grafana Dashboard

A publicly available Grafana dashboard for Micrometer-sourced JVM and Tomcat metrics is available https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701[here].

image::img/prometheus-dashboard.png[Grafana dashboard for JVM and Tomcat binders]

The dashboard features:

* JVM memory
* Process memory (provided by https://github.com/mweirauch/micrometer-jvm-extras[micrometer-jvm-extras])
* CPU-Usage, Load, Threads, File Descriptors, Log Events
* JVM Memory Pools (Heap, Non-Heap)
* Garbage Collection
* Classloading
* Direct/Mapped buffer sizes

Instead of using the `job` tag to distinct different applications, this dashboard makes use of a common tag called `application` applied to every metric. You can apply the common tag with:

[source,java]
----
registry.config().commonTags("application", "MYAPPNAME");
----

In Spring Boot applications, you can use `MeterRegistryCustomizer` to apply common tags to auto-configured registries:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
MeterRegistryCustomizer<MeterRegistry> metricsCommonTags() {
  return registry -> registry.config().commonTags("application", "MYAPPNAME");
}
----

=== Counters

The query that generates a graph for the random-walk counter is
`rate(counter[10s])`.

Representing a counter without rate normalization over some time window is rarely useful, as the representation is a function of both the rapidity with which the counter is incremented and the longevity of the service. It is generally most useful to rate normalize these time series to reason about them. Since Prometheus keeps track of discrete events across all time, it has the advantage of allowing for the selection of an arbitrary time window across which to normalize at query time (for example, `rate(counter[10s])` provides a notion of requests per second over 10 second windows). The rate-normalized graph above would return back to a value around 55 as soon as the new instance (say on a production deployment) was in service.

In contrast, without rate normalization, the counter drops back to zero on service restart, and the count increases without bound for the duration of the service's uptime.

=== Timers

The Prometheus `Timer` produces two counter time series with different names:

1. `${name}_count` - Total number of all calls.
2. `${name}_sum` - Total time of all calls.

Representing a counter without rate normalization over some time window is rarely useful, as the representation is a function of both the rapidity with which the counter is incremented and the longevity of the service.

Using the following Prometheus queries, we can graph the most commonly used statistics about timers:

1. Average latency: `rate(timer_sum[10s])/rate(timer_count[10s])`
2. Throughput (requests per second): `rate(timer_count[10s])`

=== Long task timers

The Prometheus query to plot the duration of a long task timer for a serial task is `long_task_timer_sum`. In Grafana, we can set an alert threshold at some fixed point.
