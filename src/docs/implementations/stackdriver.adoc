Stackdriver Monitoring is a dimensional time-series SaaS with built-in dashboarding.

NOTE: Stackdriver Monitoring support was added in Micrometer 1.1.0.

== Configuring

[source,java]
----
StackdriverConfig stackdriverConfig = new StackdriverConfig() {
    @Override
    public String projectId() {
        return MY_PROJECT_ID;
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String key) {
        return null;
    }
}

MeterRegistry registry = StackdriverMeterRegistry.builder(stackdriverConfig).build();
----

`StackdriverConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.stackdriver` directly to the `StackdriverConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.stackdriver:
    project-id: MY_PROJECT_ID

    # You will probably want to disable Stackdriver Monitoring publishing in a local development profile.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Stackdriver Monitoring. The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m
----

For most environments, you need to create and configure credentials to push metrics to Stackdriver Monitoring.
In most cases, you should create a service account with Stackdriver Monitoring permissions, and configure
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environmental variable to the path of the service account key file.

For example:
[source]
----
export PROJECT_ID=MY_PROJECT_ID
export APP_NAME=MY_APP

# Create a service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create $APP_NAME

# Grant the service account Stackdriver Monitoring writer permission
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member serviceAccount:$APP_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/monitoring.metricWriter

# Create a key JSON file
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $HOME/$APP_NAME-key.json \
  --iam-account $APP_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Configure GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/$APP_NAME-key.json
----

When running in managed environments such as Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run, Google Cloud Function,
you don't need to configure this environmental variable. In those environments, a service account is
automatically associated with the application instance. The underlying Stackdriver Monitoring client
library can automatically detect and use those credentials.
