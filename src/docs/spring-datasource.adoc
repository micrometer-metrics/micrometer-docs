Data sources can be instrumented with the registry. This requires the `DataSourcePoolMetadataProvider` automatically configured by Spring Boot, so it only works in a Spring Boot context where these providers are configured.

```java
@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {
    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Autowired
    private Collection<DataSourcePoolMetadataProvider> metadataProviders;

    @Autowired
    private MeterRegistry registry;

    @Autowired
    private Environment env;

    @PostConstruct
    private void instrumentDataSource() {
        new DataSourceMetrics(
            dataSource,
            metadataProviders,
            "data.source", // base metric name
            Tags.zip("stack", env.acceptsProfiles("prod") ? "prod" : "test")
        ).bindTo(registry);
    }
}
```

Data source instrumentation results in gauges representing the currently active, maximum allowed, and minimum allowed connections in the pool. Each of these gauges has a name which is prefixed by the provided name ("data.source" in this example).

The original data source instance is unchanged by instrumentation.
