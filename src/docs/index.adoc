== Meters

Micrometer packs with a supported set of `Meter` primitives including:
`Timer`, `Counter`, `Gauge`, `DistributionSummary`, and `LongTaskTimer`. Note that different meter types
result in a different number of metrics. For example, while there is a single metric that represents a
`Gauge`, a `Timer` measures both number of timed events and the total time of all events timed.

A meter is uniquely identified by its name and dimensions.

== Summary statistics

Micrometer provides quantile statistics computed at instrumentation time and histograms for use
in calculating quantile statistics at query time for monitoring systems that support this.

== Binders

Meter binders define collections of meters to add to a registry. Binders are used to
encapsulate the best practices for monitoring a certain types of objects or a part
of the application's environment. Micrometer ships with a basic set of binders.
