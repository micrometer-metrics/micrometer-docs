Timers and distribution summaries can be enriched with histogram statistics that yield a counter time series for each of a set of buckets.

Histograms can be used to compute quantiles or other summary statistics in some monitoring backends (an example from Prometheus is (https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/functions/#histogram_quantile)). Because histograms buckets are exposed as individual counters to the monitoring backend, it is possible to aggregate observations across a distributed system and compute summary statistics like quantiles for an entire cluster.

Naturally, the error rate of the computed summary statistic will be higher because of the lossy nature of putting data in buckets.

`spring-metrics` supports both cumulative and non-cumulative (normal) histograms and provides a set of generators for each. The following code shows the creation of a cumulative historgram.

```java
DistributionSummary hist = meterRegistry.summaryBuilder("hist")
        .histogram(CumulativeHistogram.buckets(linear(0, 10, 20)))
        .create();
```

For timers, you can use `timerBuilder(name)`, which mirrors this construction.

This sample constructs a cumulative histogram consisting of 20 buckets, one every 10 units beginning at 0.

To construct a normal histogram, use the generators on `NormalHistogram`.

For timers, be sure to specify the `TimeUnit` that your buckets represent. The bucket tag value on the time series will be normalized to the expected time base unit of the monitoring backend (for example, seconds on Prometheus, nanoseconds on Atlas). In this way, you can keep your histograms backend agnostic.

```java
CumulativeHistogram.buckets(linear(0, 10, 20), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
```
