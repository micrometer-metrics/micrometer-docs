Timers and distribution summaries can be enriched with histogram statistics that yield a counter
time series for each of a set of buckets.

Histograms can be used to compute quantiles or other summary statistics in some monitoring backends
(e.g. https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/functions/#histogram_quantile[Prometheus]). Because histograms
buckets are exposed as individual counters to the monitoring backend, it is possible to aggregate
observations across a distributed system and compute summary statistics like quantiles for an entire
cluster.

Naturally, the error rate of the computed summary statistic will be higher because of the lossy nature of bucketing data.

`spring-metrics` supports both cumulative and non-cumulative (normal) histograms and provides a set of
generators for each.

```java
DistributionSummary hist = meterRegistry.summaryBuilder("hist")
        .histogram(CumulativeHistogram.buckets(linear(0, 10, 20)))
        .create();
```

For timers, you can use `timerBuilder(name)` which mirrors this construction.

This sample constructs a cumulative histogram consisting of 20 buckets, one every 10 units
beginning at 0.

To construct a normal histogram, use the generators on `NormalHistogram`.

For timers, be sure to specify the `TimeUnit` that your buckets represent. The bucket tag value
on the time series will be normalized to the expected time base unit of the monitoring backend
(e.g. seconds on Prometheus, nanoseconds on Atlas). In this way, you can keep your histograms
backend agnostic.

```java
CumulativeHistogram.buckets(linear(0, 10, 20), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
```
