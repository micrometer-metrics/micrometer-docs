== Purpose

Micrometer is a metrics instrumentation library for JVM-based applications. It provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, letting you instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. It is designed to add little to no overhead to your metrics collection activity while maximizing the portability of your metrics effort.

Starting from Micrometer 1.10, Micrometer provides the link:../docs/observation[Observation API] and a plugin mechanism that lets you add capabilities, including the tracing features. You can read more about this in the link:../docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing documentation].

For better understanding of the differences among these different types of systems (Metrics, Distributed Tracing, and Logging) we recommend Adrian Cole's talk, titled https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/04/adrian-cole-observability-3-ways-logging-metrics-tracing[Observability
3 Ways]. To learn more about Micrometer Observation API, we recommend Tommy Ludwig's and Marcin Grzejszczak's talk, titled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh3VbrPvAjg[Observability of Your Application].

== Dependencies

The `micrometer-core` module aims to have minimal dependencies. It does not require any third-party (non-Micrometer) dependencies on the classpath at compile time for applications that use Micrometer.

Use of the link:#_pause_detection[pause detection] feature requires the https://github.com/LatencyUtils/LatencyUtils[LatencyUtils] dependency to be available on the classpath at runtime. If your application does not use the pause detection feature, you can exclude LatencyUtils from your runtime classpath.

 If you use link:#_histograms_and_percentiles[client-side percentiles], you need the https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram[HdrHistogram] on the classpath at runtime. If you do not use client-side percentiles, you may exclude HdrHistogram from your application's runtime classpath.
