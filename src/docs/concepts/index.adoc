== Purpose

Micrometer is a metrics instrumentation library for JVM-based applications. It provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, letting you instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. It is designed to add little to no overhead to your metrics collection activity while maximizing the portability of your metrics effort.

Micrometer is _not_ a distributed tracing system or an event logger. In Micrometer 1.10, we do however provide a plugin mechanism that allows you to add capabilities including the tracing features. You can read more about this in the link:../docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing documentation].

For better understanding the differences among these different types of systems (Metrics, Distributed Tracing, and Logging) we recommend Adrian Cole's talk, titled https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/04/adrian-cole-observability-3-ways-logging-metrics-tracing[Observability
3 Ways].

== Dependencies

The `micrometer-core` module aims to have minimal dependencies. It does not require any third-party (non-Micrometer) dependencies on the classpath at compile time for applications using Micrometer.

Use of the link:#_pause_detection[pause detection] feature requires the https://github.com/LatencyUtils/LatencyUtils:[LatencyUtils] dependency to be available on the classpath at runtime. If your application does not use the pause detection feature, you can exclude LatencyUtils from your runtime classpath.

https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram:[HdrHistogram] is needed on the classpath at runtime if you use link:#_histograms_and_percentiles[client-side percentiles]. If you are not using client-side percentiles, you may exclude HdrHistogram from your application's runtime classpath.
