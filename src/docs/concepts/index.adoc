== Purpose

Micrometer is a metrics instrumentation library for JVM-based applications. It provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. It is designed to add little to no overhead to your metrics collection activity while maximizing the portability of your metrics effort.

Micrometer is _not_ a distributed tracing system or an event logger. Adrian Cole's talk on https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/04/adrian-cole-observability-3-ways-logging-metrics-tracing[Observability
3 Ways] does a great job of highlighting the differences between these different types of systems.
