Timers and distribution summaries support collecting data to observe their percentile distributions. There are two main approaches to viewing percentiles:

1. *Percentile histograms* - Micrometer accumulates values to an underlying histogram and ships a predetermined set of buckets to the monitoring system. The monitoring system's query language is responsible for calculating percentiles off of this histogram. Currently, only Prometheus and Atlas support histogram-based percentile approximations, via `histogram_quantile` and `:percentile`, respectively. If targeting Prometheus or Atlas, prefer this approach, since you can aggregate the histograms across dimensions (by simply summing the values of the buckets across a set of dimensions) and derive an aggregable percentile from the histogram.
2. *Client-side percentiles* - Micrometer computes a percentile approximation for each meter ID (set of name and tags) and ships the percentile value to the monitoring system. This is not as flexible as a percentile histogram because it is not possible to aggregate percentile approximations across tags. Nevertheless, it provides some level of insight into percentile distributions for monitoring systems that don't support server-side percentile calculation based on a histogram.

Here is an example of building a timer with a histogram:

[source,java]
----
Timer.builder("my.timer")
   .publishPercentiles(0.5, 0.95) // median and 95th percentile
   .publishPercentileHistogram()
   .sla(Duration.ofMillis(100))
   .minimumExpectedValue(Duration.ofMillis(1))
   .maximumExpectedValue(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
----

1. `publishPercentiles` - This is used to publish percentile values computed in your app. These values are non-aggregable across dimensions.
2. `publishPercentileHistogram` - This is used to publish a histogram suitable for computing aggregable (across dimensions) percentile approximations in Prometheus using `histogram_quantile` and Atlas using `:percentile`. The buckets in the resulting histogram are preset by Micrometer based on a generator that has been determined empirically by Netflix to yield a reasonable error bound on most real world timers and distribution summaries. The generator yields 276 buckets by default, but Micrometer only ships those that are within the range set by `minimumExpectedValue` and `maximumExpectedValue`, inclusive. Micrometer clamps timers by default to a range of 1 millisecond to 1 minute, yielding 73 histogram buckets per timer dimension. `publishPercentileHistogram` has no effect on systems that do not support aggregable percentile approximations -- no histogram is shipped for these systems.
3. `sla` - Publish a cumulative histogram with buckets defined by your SLAs. Used in concert with `publishPercentileHistogram` on a monitoring system that supports aggregable percentiles, this setting adds additional buckets to the published histogram. Used on a system that does not support aggregable percentiles, this setting causes a histogram to be published with only these buckets.
4. `minimumExpectedValue`/`maximumExpectedValue` - Controls the number of buckets shipped by `publishPercentileHistogram` as well as controlling the accuracy and memory footprint of the underlying HdrHistogram structure.

Since shipping percentiles to the monitoring system generates additional time series, it is generally preferable to *not* configure them in core libraries that are included as dependencies in apps. Instead, apps can turn on this behavior for some set of timers/distribution summaries via a meter filter.

For example, suppose we have a handful of timers in a common library. We've prefixed these timer names with `myservice`:

[source,java]
----
registry.timer("myservice.http.requests").record(..);
registry.timer("myservice.db.requests").record(..);
----

We can turn on client-side percentiles for both timers via a meter filter:

[source,java]
----
registry.config().meterFilter(
    new MeterFilter() {
        @Override
        public HistogramConfig configure(Meter.Id id, HistogramConfig config) {
            if(id.getName().startsWith("myservice")) {
                return HistogramConfig.builder()
                    .percentiles(0.95)
                    .build()
                    .merge(config);
            }
            return config;
        }
    });
