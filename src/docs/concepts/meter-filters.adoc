Each registry can be configured with meter filters, which allow you to exercise greater control over how and when meters are registered and what kinds of statistics they emit. Meter filters serve three basic functions:

1. **Deny** (or accept) meters from being registered.
2. **Transform** meter IDs (e.g. changing the name, adding or removing tags, changing description or base units).
3. **Configure** distribution statistics for some meter types.

Implementations of `MeterFilter` are added to the registry programmatically:

[source, java]
----
registry.config()
    .meterFilter(MeterFilter.ignoreTags("too.much.information")
    .meterFilter(MeterFilter.denyNameStartsWith("jvm");
----

Meter filters are applied in order and the results of transforming or configuring a meter are chained.

== Deny/accept meters

The verbose form of an accept/deny filter is:

[source, java]
----
new MeterFilter() {
    @Override
    public MeterFilterReply accept(Meter.Id id) {
       if(id.getName().contains("test")) {
          return MeterFilterReply.DENY;
       }
       return MeterFilterReply.NEUTRAL;
    }
}
----

`MeterFilterReply` has three possible states:

* `DENY` - Do not allow this meter to be registered. When you attempt to register a meter against a registry and the filter returns DENY the registry will return a NOOP version of that meter (e.g. `NoopCounter`, `NoopTimer`). Your code can continue to interact with the NOOP meter, but anything recorded to it is discarded immediately with minimal overhead.
* `NEUTRAL` - If no other meter filter has returned `DENY`, then registration of meters proceeds as normal.
* `ACCEPT` - If a filter returns `ACCEPT`, the meter is immediately registered without interrogating any further filters' accept methods.

=== Convenience methods

`MeterFilter` provides several convenience static builders for deny/accept type filters:

* `accept()` - Accept every meter, overriding the decisions of any filters that follow.
* `accept(Predicate<Meter.Id>)` - Accept any meter matching the predicate.
* `acceptNameStartsWith(String)` - Accept every meter with a matching prefix.
* `deny()` - Deny every meter, overriding the decisions of any filters that follow.
* `denyNameStartsWith(String)` - Deny every meter with a matching prefix. All out-of-the-box `MeterBinder` implementations provided by Micrometer have names with common prefixes to allow for easy grouping visualization in UIs, but also to make them easy to disable/enable as a group with a prefix. For example, you can deny all JVM metrics with `MeterFilter.denyNameStartsWith("jvm")`
* `deny(Predicate<Meter.Id>)` - Deny any meter matching the predicate.
* `maximumAllowableMetrics(int)` - Denies any meter after the registry has reached a certain number of meters.
* `maximumAllowableTags(String meterNamePrefix, String tagKey, int maximumTagValues, MeterFilter onMaxReached)` - Places an upper bound on the number of tags produced by matching series.

**Whitelisting** only a certain group of metrics is a particularly common case for monitoring systems that are _expensive_. This can be achieved with the static:

* `denyUnless(Predicate<Meter.Id>)` - Deny all meters that _don't_ match the predicate.

=== Chaining deny/accept meters

Meter filters are applied in the order in which they are configured on the registry, so it is possible to stack deny/accept filters to achieve more complex rules:

[source, java]
----
registry.config()
    .meterFilter(MeterFilter.acceptNameStartsWith("http"))
    .meterFilter(MeterFilter.deny()); <1>
----

This achieves another form of whitelisting by stacking two filters together. Only "http" metrics will exist in this registry.

== Transforming metrics

A transform filter looks like this:

[source, java]
----
new MeterFilter() {
    @Override
    public Meter.Id map(Meter.Id id) {
       if(id.getName().startsWith("test")) {
          return id.withName("extra." + id.getName()).withTag("extra.tag", "value");
       }
       return id;
    }
}
----

This filter adds a name prefix and an additional tag conditionally to meters starting with the name "test".

`MeterFilter` provides convenience builders for many common transformation cases:

* `commonTags(Iterable<Tag>)` - Add a set of tags to all metrics. Adding common tags for app name, host, region, etc is a highly recommended practice.
* `ignoreTags(String...)` - Drop matching tag keys from every meter. This is particularly useful when a tag provably becomes
too high cardinality and starts stressing your monitoring system or costing too much, but you can't change all the instrumentation points quickly.
* `replaceTagValues(String tagKey, Function<String, String> replacement, String... exceptions)` - Replace tag values according to the provided mapping for all matching tag keys. This can be used to reduce the total cardinality of a tag by mapping some portion of tag values to something else.
* `renameTag(String meterNamePrefix, String fromTagKey, String toTagKey)` - Rename a tag key for every metric beginning with a given prefix.

== Configuring distribution statistics

`Timer` and `DistributionSummary` contain a set of optional distribution statistics in addition to the basics of count, total, and max that can be configured through filters. These distribution statistics include pre-computed percentiles, SLAs, and histograms.

[source, java]
----
new MeterFilter() {
    @Override
    public DistributionStatisticConfig configure(Meter.Id id, DistributionStatisticConfig config) {
        if (id.getName().startsWith(prefix)) {
            return DistributionStatisticConfig.builder()
                    .publishPercentiles(0.9, 0.95)
                    .build()
                    .merge(config);
        }
        return config;
    }
};
----

Generally, you should create a new `DistributionStatisticConfig` with just the pieces you wish to configure and then `merge` it with the input configuration. This allows you to drop-down on registry provided defaults for distribution statistics and to chain multiple filters together, each which configures some part of the distribution statistics (e.g. maybe you want a 100ms SLA for all http requests but only percentile histograms on a few critical endpoints).

`MeterFilter` provides convenience builders for:

* `maxExpected(Duration/long)` - Governs the upper bound of percentile histogram buckets shipped from a timer or summary.
* `minExpected(Duration/long)` - Governs the lower bound of percentile histogram buckets shipped from a timer or summary.

Spring Boot offers property-based filters for configuring SLAs, percentiles, and percentile histograms by name prefix.
